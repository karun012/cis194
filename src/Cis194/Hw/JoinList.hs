-- ** Exercise 1
-- Write an append function for JoinLists
-- that yields a new JoinList whose monoidal annotation is derived from
-- those of the two arguments.

(+++) :: Monoid m => JoinList m a -> JoinList m a -> JoinList m a
(+++) jl1 jl2 = Append (tag jl1 `mappend` tag jl2) jl1 jl2

--  You may find it helpful to implement a helper function
--  which gets the annotation at the root of a JoinList.

tag (Single m a) = m
tag (Empty) = mempty
tag (Append m jl1 jl2) = tag jl1 `mappend` tag jl2
